# Overview

This repo contains dags for collecting currency pairs, both the current FX exchange rate and an indication of the change compared to yesterdayâ€™s rate at 5PM New York time.

The structure of repository is taken from [Astro](https://github.com/astronomer/airflow-quickstart). 

## Implementation

The task implemented using Apache Airflow. The logic is to ingest the data into `rate_event` table, then, executuon time is 5PM in New York - update `comparable_rate` table with newest rates to compare. Lastly, insert active rates into `display_rates` table. The logic is the same for all dags. 

Implementation is not fully complete, because it's more to demonstrate my working style than to create a project for production, so there are comments for these improvements in the code.

## Dags
This repository contains 5 DAGs:

- `A-hourly-job`: This DAG ingests rates from the file hourly, transforms the data and writes rates for display into the `display_rate` table.
- `B-minute-job`: This DAG ingests rates from the file every minute, transforms the data and writes rates for display into the 'display_rate' table.
- `listen_to_the_stream`: This DAG listens to a Kafka stream and triggers a task when a new message is received.
- `refresh_rates`: This DAG refreshes rates by inserting Kafka source data, refreshing comparable rates, and reading and writing the transformed data (same as A or B jobs, but only when triggered).
- `produce_rate_event`: This DAG produces rate events to a Kafka topic.

## Data storage

For data storage Postges database is used and there are 3 tables:
- `display_rates`: contains data for LED screen.
- `rate_event`: contains all currency events.
- `comparable_rate`: contains rates for yesterday 5PM New York time.

## Run locally

1. Install the Astro CLI by following the steps in the [Astro CLI documentation](https://docs.astronomer.io/astro/cli/install-cli). Docker Desktop/Docker Engine is a prerequisite.
2. Run `astro dev start` in your cloned repository.
4. Connect to Postgres database ([instructions](https://www.commandprompt.com/education/how-to-create-a-postgresql-database-in-docker/)) and run these commands:
    * `CREATE TABLE display_rate(ID INT PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL, CCY_COUPLE TEXT NOT NULL, RATE DOUBLE PRECISION NOT NULL, CHANGE REAL NOT NULL);`
    * `CREATE TABLE rate_event(EVENT_ID BIGINT PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL, EVENT_TIME BIGINT NOT NULL, CCY_COUPLE TEXT NOT NULL, RATE DOUBLE PRECISION NOT NULL);`
    * `CREATE TABLE comparable_rate(ID BIGINT PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL, EVENT_TIME BIGINT NOT NULL, CCY_COUPLE TEXT NOT NULL, RATE DOUBLE PRECISION NOT NULL);`
3. After your Astro project has started. View the Airflow UI at `localhost:8080`.
